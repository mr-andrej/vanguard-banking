# Vanguard
Vanguard is a financial platform that offers comprehensive tools for managing personal finances. It integrates with multiple bank accounts to provide real-time transaction tracking and allows seamless money transfers between users. While intended to be a demonstration, the end goal is to be able to launch it and have it work with the users' actual bank accounts.

## Getting Started
Firstly, make sure to install all dependencies with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm install
```


Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
